# 🦴 Scoliosis Detection using Classical Computer Vision

A Python-based computer vision tool that detects spinal curvature (Scoliosis) from 2D back-view images. Unlike deep learning approaches that require massive labeled datasets, this project uses **classical image processing** and **geometric analysis** to quantify asymmetry.
